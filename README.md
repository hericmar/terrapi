# TerraPi
Simple manager of environments such as terrariums, aquariums, or greenhouses.
Measure temperature, humidity, and other physical quantities, 
and control devices such as fans, heaters, and lights,
and collect the data and plot them into graphs.

> **Note**: This is hobby project and is not intended for production use.

The project consists of Raspberry Pi client implementation, 
a broker server that collects data, 
and a web interface that plots the data into graphs. 

## Requirements
- Raspberry Pi computer for client control unit (tested on Raspberry Pi Zero).
  Please note that Raspberry Pi 5 is not supported, because WiringPi library is not compatible with it.
- Optional: PostgreSQL database server for the broker.

## Instalation
See [terrapi](./terrapi/README.md) and [broker](./broker/README.md) for installation instructions.

## Configuration
### Supported sensors

### Value types (Physical quantities)
Using only SI units.
Supported both in client and broker.

| Name | Unit | Description |
